# CSS_Animation-Page

This repository contains all of the personal projects that I did in FreeCodeCamp in HTML and CSS for the animation modules.
The repository of other CSS Projects: [View Repository](https://m-valdy.github.io/CSS_Recipe-Page)

## Projects

### 1. 🎡 Ferris Wheel

A ferris made with HTML and CSS. This is the first animation project I have ever made in HTML and CSS, the FreeCodeCamp prompt wasn't this complicated, but for the background I imported the code for the City Skyline Project old project I did in my other repository.

- **Folder**: `ferris_wheel`

### 2, 🌎 Moon Orbit
A semi-planetary model made with HTML and CSS. I didn't import any other piece of code for this one so to be honest it was pretty easy.
