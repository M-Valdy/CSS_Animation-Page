## Projects

### 1. ðŸŽ¡ Ferris Wheel

A ferris made with HTML and CSS. This is the first animation project I have ever made in HTML and CSS, the FreeCodeCamp prompt wasn't this complicated, but for the background I imported the code for the City Skyline Project old project I did in my other repository.
